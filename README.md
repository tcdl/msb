## Installation

```
$ npm install msb --save
```

## Usage

```js
var msb = require('msb');
```

See [examples](example) of the patterns below.

### Pub/Sub

Every message-broker pattern in this module is based on one of these publish/subscribe patterns. Producers publish messages to a topic on the microservicebus, which gets delivered to subscribed consumers.

![MSB Pub/Sub](doc/pub-sub.png)

- Multiple producers can publish messages on the same topic.
- Producers have no control over how many times its messages are consumed.
- It is the responsibility of consuming services to define how they want to consume messages from a specific topic.
- You can combine different consumer patterns on a single topic.

#### Broadcast

The broadcaster should ensure their messages are formatted according to the [envelope schema](schema.js). A time-to-live (ttl) can be optionally provided to ensure messages cannot be delivered after this amount of milliseconds. (This value is sensitive to synchronisation of clocks between producers and consumers.) The payload should be provided as a JSON-serializable object.

```js
var message = messageFactory.createBroadcastMessage({
  namespace: 'test:pubsub',
  ttl: 30000 // Optional
})

message.payload = { /* ... */ }
```

The implementer should decide how they want to handle messages that cannot be delivered to the message broker, i.e. where an error is passed back.

```js
msb
.channelManager
.findOrCreateProducer('test:pubsub')
.publish(message, function(err) {
  if (err) return debug(err)

  //...
})
```

#### Deliver to All

All listeners will receive all messages published to this topic, as long as they are online at the time the message is published.

```js
msb
.channelManager
.findOrCreateConsumer('test:pubsub', { groupId: false })
.on('message', function(message) {
  //...
})
.on('error', debug)
```

#### Deliver Once (AMQP Only)

Only one listener will receive each message published to the specified topic.

##### Online Listeners Only

Listeners will only receive messages published while they are online.

```js
msb
.channelManager
.findOrCreateConsumer('test:pubsub', {
  groupId: 'example-string'
})
.on('message', function(message) {
  //...
})
.on('error', debug)
```

##### Queued While Offline

Listeners will also receive messages published while they were offline, queued up in the message broker. Messages that has a time-to-live (ttl) specified will not be delivered after this time has been exceeded.

Note that messages will only be queued from the first time this listener has been instantiated.

```js
msb
.channelManager
.findOrCreateConsumer('test:pubsub', {
  groupId: 'example-string',
  durable: true
})
.on('message', function(message) {
  //...
})
.on('error', debug)
```

### Request/Response

#### Request

##### 1-1

The simplest way to do a 1-1 request is to provide only a topic and a JSON-serializable payload. Should multiple responders attempt to respond, only the first response to be received will be provided to the callback.

```js
msb.request('example:topic', payload, function(err, payload, _fullMesssage) {
  if (err) return debug(err)

  //...
});
```

Additional settings can be provided:

```js
msb.request({
  namespace: 'example:topic',
  waitForResponsesMs: 1000
}, payload, function(err, payload, _fullMesssage) {
  if (err) return debug(err)

  //...
});
```

##### 1-n

A single payload is published with a return topic derived from the namespace that will ensure responses are received by this requester.

###### Timeout-based

The requester will listen for multiple responses for the specified amount of time.

```js
var requester = msb.Requester({
  namespace: 'example:topic',
  waitForResponsesMs: 10000 // a.k.a. responseTimeout
})

requester
.on('payload', function(payload, _fullMessage) {
  //...
})
.on('error', function(err) {
  debug(err)
})
.on('end', function() {
  //... Note: won't fire if the requester encountered an error
})
.publish(payload)
```

###### Number of Responses

The requester will 'end' once this number of responses have been received.

```js
var requester = msb.Requester({
  namespace: 'example:topic',
  waitForResponses: 1
})

//...
```

###### With Acks

Responders have the ability to change the expected number of responses or how long the requester should wait for responses from that responder. If you want to guarantee that the requester will wait for such messages (acks) to be received, you should specify a minimum time for the requester to wait.

```js
var requester = msb.Requester({
  namespace: 'example:topic',
  waitForAcksMs: 1000, // a.k.a. ackTimeout
  waitForResponses: 1
})

//...
```

In the above case, the requester will only ever end after the specified `waitForAcksMs`.

#### Response

##### 1-1

A single response (per responder) for each incoming request.

```js
msb.Responder.createServer({
  namespace: 'example:topic'
})
.use(function(request, response, next) {
  var body = {}

  response.writeHead(200) // HTTP-compatible
  response.end(body) // To be provided in response `payload.body`
})
.listen()
```

##### 1-ack+1 (Middleware-style Server Pattern)

An ack is sent to ensure the requester will continue to wait for this response.

```js
msb.Responder.createServer({
  namespace: 'example:topic'
})
.use(function(request, response, next) {
  var expectedResponses = 1
  var expectedTimeForResponse = 3000

  response.responder.sendAck(expectedResponses, expectedTimeForResponse, next)
})
.use(function(request, response, next) {
  var body = {}

  response.writeHead(200) // HTTP-compatible
  response.end(body) // To be provided in response `payload.body`
})
.listen()
```

##### 1-ack+n (Responder-Emitter Pattern)

An ack is sent to ensure the requester will wait for the multiple responses being prepared.

```js
msb.Responder.createEmitter({
  namespace: 'example:topic'
})
.on('responder', function(responder) {

  responder.sendAck(3, 5000)

  var i = 0;
  while (i++ < 3) {
    var payload = {
      body: {
        //...
      }
    }

    responder.send(payload, function(err) {
      if (err) return debug(err)
    })
  }
})
```

## Configuration

### channelManager.configure(config)

Loads the provided config object over the configuration for the channelManager. E.g.

```js
msb.configure(config); // Default channelManager, or
msb.createChannelManager().configure(config); // Additional channelManager
```

*Note: It is recommended that you do not re-configure after publisher/subscriber channels have been created.*

### Environment Variables

- MSB_SERVICE_NAME The string used to identify the type of service, also used as the default for the broker groupId. (Default: `name` in the package.json of the main module.)
- MSB_SERVICE_VERSION (Default: `version` in the package.json of the main module.)
- MSB_SERVICE_INSTANCE_ID (Default: generated universally unique 12-byte/24-char hex string.)
- MSB_BROKER_ADAPTER One of 'amqp' or 'local' (Default: 'amqp')
- MSB_BROKER_HOST and MSB_BROKER_PORT Maps to appropriate values in `config.amqp` overriding defaults.
- MSB_BROKER_RECONNECT A boolean which determines whether the connection with the broker should be automatically recovered from failures (Default: 'false')
- MSB_CONFIG_PATH Loads the JSON/JS file at this path over the base channelManager configuration. Similar to calling `channelManager.configure(config)` programmatically.

### Connection recovery
By default, MSB does not automatically recover failed connection with the broker. When a connection failure occurs, an error will be raised and the application process will terminate. This behaviour can be overridden by setting `MSB_BROKER_RECONNECT=true`. There is a drawback in the implementation of that functionality though. The reconnection will be done silently, without emitting any events or logging errors. Due to that it might be hard to understand if a microservice is connected to the broker or is in the middle of connection retry.

## Tools

### CLI Listener

Listens to a topic on the bus and prints JSON to stdout. By default it will also listen for response topics detected on messages, and JSON is pretty-printed. For [Newline-delimited JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_Delimited_JSON) compatibility, specify `-p false`.

```js
$ node_modules/msb/bin/msb -t topic:to:listen:to
```

Or if globally installed, i.e. `npm install msb -g`:

```
$ msb -t topic:to:listen:to
```

Options:
- **--topic** or **-t**
- **--follow** or **-f** listen for following topics, empty to disable (Default: response)
- **--pretty** or **-p** set to false to use as a newline-delimited json stream, (Default: true)

## Message Brokers / Adapters

### AMQP / RabbitMQ

RabbitMQ is the default message broker used. The AMQP adapter is tested with RabbitMQ and it implements a limited topology for simplification. One exchange is created per topic and a queue is created for every group of similar services, configured using a groupId. This means that you can have different types of services listening on the same topic, and multiple processes of the same type of service would receive a fair distribution of messages.

```

#### channelManager.findOrCreateProducer(topic)

Returns a producer for this topic. Either existing or new. Corresponding `channelManager` events will be emitted for this producer.

#### channelManager.findOrCreateConsumer(topic[, options])

Returns a consumer listening on this topic. Either existing or new. Corresponding channelManager events will be emitted for this consumer. If `config.cleanupConsumers` is set, these consumers will be removed as soon as there are no more listeners for them. If an app-wide schema exists, it will be checked for every incoming message.

- **topic** String
- **options.groupId** String Custom group identifier for round-robin message queue.
- **options.groupId** Boolean Set to `false` for broadcast-style message queue.

- **error** Error object, the cause of disconnection

#### Event: 'error'

An error occurred on adapter level, e.g. unrecoverable connection loss (if connection recovery is disabled)

- **error** Error object

### Producer

(Created using the `channelManager.findOrCreateProducer`.)

#### producer.publish(message, cb)

- **message** Either a string or an object that will be converted to JSON.
- **cb** cb(err) Function that is called after transmission has completed.

### Consumer

(Created using the `channelManager.findOrCreateConsumer`.)

#### consumer.close()

Stops listening for messages on this topic. If `config.cleanupConsumers` is set, and this consumer was created using `channelManager.findOrCreateConsumer`, it would be removed from the `channelManager`.

#### consumer.onceConsuming(cb)

- **cb** Function that is called if the consumer is already consuming or once when it next starts consuming.

#### consumer.confirmProcessedMessage(message)

Confirms with the broker (where supported) that processing of this message has completed. Only works where the broker-adapter is AMQP, and where `config.autoConfirm` is set to `false`.

- **message** The message originally emitted by this consumer, by reference.

#### consumer.rejectMessage(message)

Confirms with the broker (where supported) that this message should not be processed, e.g. in cases such as invalid message or TTL reached. Only works where the broker-adapter is AMQP, and where `config.autoConfirm` is set to `false`.

- **message** The message originally emitted by this consumer, by reference.

#### Event: 'message'

- **message** a parsed object, validated using the app-wide `config.schema`.

#### Event: 'error'
